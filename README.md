For my internship, I needed to have the population of each ethnicity in different zipcodes.

At first, I thought of looking for the dataset online. 
As i could not find it, I decided to build my very own web scraper that would do that.

Then I built this versatile code which would go on the 'city-data' website and give me the required data for any zipcode.

Also, this code can be used to scrape any information, available on city data website, for any zipcode.
